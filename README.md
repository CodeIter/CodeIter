# @CodeIter

Passionate developer & open-source enthusiast creating innovative solutions with code. Constant learner & proud sponsor of creators. Sponsor my work for impactful contributions! #CodeIter

Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a code writer and lover of challenges with a keen interest in technology.

My name is Muhammad Amin Boubaker, a Muslim and a passionate developer and open-source enthusiast from The Republic of Tunisia.

You may know me better as CodeIter on GitHub, Twitter X, Facebook and other social media platforms.

As a constant learner and proud sponsor of creators, I am committed to making impactful contributions to the community with innovative solutions created through code.

Currently, I am working on several web development projects and exploring new technologies to improve my skills.

Your sponsorship would help me to continue my work, support open-source projects, and bring more value to the community.

Aside from coding, I am also a lover of challenges and have a keen interest in technology.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, making me somewhat of a food expert :smile:.

I am excited to be part of the GitHub community and collaborate with other developers and creators.

Thank you for your consideration and support! üôèüèº
